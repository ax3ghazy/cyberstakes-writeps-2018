# Hello World - Points: 1

### Description:

You can see the number of points this challenge is worth above (1). Typically the more points a challenge is worth the harder it is. Also, if a challenge has few solves it is probably difficult. You don't have to solve in order, so if you get stumped feel free to jump around.
