# Is that a warble in your voice - Points: 200

### Description:

We've intercepted more enemy transmissions! There's something different about this one, but it looks familiar.

### Hints

 - Check out GNU Radio tutorials that walk through demodulating waveforms.
 - The modulation is Frequency Shift Keying (FSK).
 - Try Quadrature demodulating the waveform into a stream of symbols, then searching the resulting stream of 1s and 0s to find the packet.
 - You can always brute force the last 3 bits...
 - WARNING: This challenge's flag does not follow the standard ACI{...} format. The flag format is 32 hexadecimal characters, /[0-9a-f]{32}/.
