# Deblur the blur - Points: 275 

### Description:

We've found an image that contains confidential information, but it's too blurry to read. Image: image.jpg

### Hints

 - Look at the big picture

### Solution

No idea why this was worth so many points.. it was just a blurry QR code. I opened it in photoshop (you could use gimp, pixlr.com, just about any photo editing software), adjusted the brightness and contrast a bit, zoomed out, and tried using a QR reader on my phone and it totally worked.
