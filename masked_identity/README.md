# Masked Identity - Points: 300

### Description:

We've found credentials for a web application that the target uses to post messages. Unfortunately, the credentials are for a non-admin user in the Marketing department. However, we have been able to compromise an admin user on a test application. See if you can compromise the admin user on the production server? Credentials: app_logins.

### Hints

 - The container interface will give you two ports. The one mapped to 8080/tcp is the test environment, the one mapped to 80 is the prod environment.
 - What can you do in the testing environment that you cannot do in the production?
 - JavaScript Web Tokens (jwt) is one of the standards for authenticating in modern web apps
 - Developer Tools in modern browsers like Chrome can provide an easy way to inspect an app's network traffic
